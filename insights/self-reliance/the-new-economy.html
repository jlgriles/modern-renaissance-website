							<h1>A New Economy</h1>
							<p>For the past several hundred years, we have been living in a single era, economically. The Industrial Age was characterized by many things, but one key element, in spite of much of what has been said, was equality; or better said, accessibility. For the first time in the history of humanity, individuality has been successful; a person or family could, by mastering very accessible skills, become wealthy and powerful. In spite of this, the bent of humanity is to centralize power. The era of industry has come to a close.</p>

							<h2>Technology's Impact on Industrialization</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The recent jumps in technology have created a new divide. This is due to many factors, both social and political. Regardless of moral proclivities, a new reality is in place. This is due to a confluence of factors that is no longer able to be changed by bureaucratic governments, or even the well-meaning protests of passionate generations. While this seems a harsh pronouncement on humanity, it's worth noting that the challenge is no longer striving between men. Technology has a momentum that, when paired with the ambition and drive to seek power which is cultivated by all major societies, is no longer resistable by human institutions.</p>

							<h2>The New Economy</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The new economy, when approached through traditional lenses, does not fit the mold of the past. It's unrealistic to expect that hundreds of years of institutionalized academia can anticipate the changes which will occur in this decade. Expedited by the COVID pandemic, the adoption of technology which divides individuals and connects societies and corporations will build the momentum of automation and AI to create economic conditions  which no longer require humanity: an autonomous commerce.</p>
							<p>What few recognize now is that already most of commerce is an end in itself: the jobs carried out by people have always been only a piece of the vision of the leaders themselves. The game of commerce is won by having the most beans and the fewest bean counters. Technology simply allows automation to do what "productive" employees have already been doing - without the human limitations.</p>

							<h2>Burnout and The Need to Be Human</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Crucially, the burnout and lack of balance crusaded against by so many has already been solved. The problem is simply slow adoption. Most of the commerce economy has already been made redundant. The reality of the world is much more organic than the paranoid conspiracy theorist allows for - there is no group which is centralizing power or expressly taking advantage of others. These trends are instead a natural conclusion of Westen society, and will continuously play out regardless of the players.</p>
							<p>Where does this lead us? The antidote to centralization and catastrophic destabilization of the economy and human sustainability is, simply, decentralization. The issue with decentralization is twofold: it runs against the predominant cultures in the world, and by definition it can't be centrally led. The solution is for people to connect with people on an individual, personal, local and selfish level - to each gain from every transaction and hold each other accountable as though our lives and the survival of humanity depends on it - because they do.</p>
